# SwiftUIShaders
Having some fun with Metal shaders using SwiftUI modifiers.

Some shaders found on [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) and converted to Metal, others written while learning from [The Book Of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/). Feel free to use, re-use and so on.

### Ideas & To do
- [ ] describe math behind each shader for learning purposes
- [ ] change `st` to `uv` in shaders as I probably misunderstood it (see [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10568390/difference-between-uv-and-st-texture-coordinates))
- [ ] find nicer way define and load list of shaders
- [ ] patterns chapter
- [ ] noise chapter

### Shader ideas
- [ ] Kiasmos sparking lava contours moving towards viewer
- [ ] cellular noise to recreate something similar to [this](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2024/06/bernhard-lang-baltic-ice/)
- [ ] zoomed in CRT "pixels" shifted and distorted regionally on Y axis
- [ ] grainy paper textures
